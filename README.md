## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.


## Installation

1. Cocoapods

**PagedLists** is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:
 

```ruby

pod 'PagedLists', '~> 1.0.0'

```

2. Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.
Add the following line to your `Cartfile` and follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application).

```
github "rootstrap/PagedLists" ~> 1.0.0
```

3. Swift Package Manager

- In XCode 11, go to File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency.
- Enter the repo URL(https://github.com/rootstrap/PagedLists) and click Next.
- Select the version rule desired(you can specify a version number, branch or commit) and click Next. This library supports SPM starting from the version 1.0.0.
- Finally, select the target where you want to use the framework.

That should be it. **PagedLists** should appear in the navigation panel as a dependency and the framework will be linked automatically to your target.


**Note:** It is always recommended to lock your external libraries to a specific version.
